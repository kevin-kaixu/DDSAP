    \caption{Given a set of heterogeneous shapes, a reliable qualitative similarity is derived from quartets composed of two pairs of objects (left).
    Aggregating such qualitative information from many quartets computed across the whole set leads to a categorization tree as a hierarchical
    organization of the input shape collection (right).}
