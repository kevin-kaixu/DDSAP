    \caption{Comparison of single-shape segmentation (left) and joint shape segmentation (right) on models from the PSB benchmark~\cite{Chen:2009:BMS}. Each segmentation on the left was produced by the top-performing algorithm in the benchmark for that shape. The segmentations on the right were produced
by~\cite{Huang:2011:JSS}, which jointly optimized segmentations and correspondences across the entire dataset.}
