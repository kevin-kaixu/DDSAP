    Given a library of models, a Bayesian network encoding semantic and geometric relationships among shape parts
    is learned~\protect\cite{Chaudhuri:2011:prabm} (top). The modeling process (bottom) performs probabilistic inference in the learned
    Bayesian network to generate ranked lists of category labels and components within each category, customized for the currently assembled model.}
